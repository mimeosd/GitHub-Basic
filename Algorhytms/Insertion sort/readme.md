## Insertion sort ##
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time by comparisons. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

* Class: Sorting algorithm
* Data structure: Array
* Worst-case performance: O(n ^ 2) comparisons and swaps
* Best-case performance: O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps
